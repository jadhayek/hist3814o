# Today I'm learning how to set up my DHbox. It's very interesting seeing how one small error or letter unwanted make everything stop working.
My friend which is a programmer used to talk to me about DHbox and how you need to instal different code banks in it depending on what you're working with. I'm guessing we need to be on the carleton vpn because we are using one of their set "language box". Can't wait to learn more.
